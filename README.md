## Project overview
* Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.</br >
* Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.</br >
* Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season. </br >

Before going into preparing and analyzing the data to find the insights needed and present them to the stake holders a project management plan was set-up to give a clear guidance of how the project will be handled.
This project management plan was presented to the applicable stake holders which are:
* Medical agency frontline staff (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors)</br >
* Hospitals and clinics using the staffing agencyâ€™s services</br >
* Influenza patients</br >
* Staffing agency administrators</br >
